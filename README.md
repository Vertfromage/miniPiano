# miniPiano
mini piano app outputting tiny js code forked from xem

I added a pianoPlayBack app to test sequences and js dropIn to use in my game.
Try the demo: https://vertfromage.github.io/miniPiano/pianoPlayback.html

# Update
No longer using this code in games because @Curtastic made an [improved version](https://github.com/curtastic/p1 )
